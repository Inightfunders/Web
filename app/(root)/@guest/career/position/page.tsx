                        This is a full-time, fully-remote position as a Backend Engineer. While we're very much still a startup in the sense that you may be asked to help with a variety of problems, in this role you can expect to spend most of your time working on the code and systems that power Insight Funder's Go-to-Market efforts.Â 
                        You'll work closely with the Sales, Marketing and Product teams and write code needed to integrate CRM and marketing tools (Salesforce, Hubspot, Sendgrid etc) within Insight Funder's backend systems.

                        We are committed to using the right tools for the problems we are trying to solve. We are not dogmatic, but currently, our stack is mostly comprised of:
                        Backend: Go, PostgreSQL, Pyspark, BigQuery, Kubernetes, Pulumi, Buildkite, Google Cloud Platform.
                        Frontend: Typescript, React, Next.js.
                        You do not need to have prior experience with ALL of these technologies. We believe great candidates are capable of learning new tools and we provide mentorship and guidance as needed.
                        We try to adopt tools that are a delight to use, and that help us be productive. We have a strong focus on always maintaining and improving developer productivity. We experiment frequently, but pragmatically, with new technology.
